# bookbinder
A little Go utility for compiling the Fretboard Foundation site into a printable book.

For usage, see the [relevant section of the Fretboard Foundation README](https://github.com/jasongrimes/fretboardfoundation?tab=readme-ov-file#generating-the-printable-single-page-version).

To recompile the binary, run `go build bookbinder.go`. 
Then copy it to [fretboardfoundation/bin](https://github.com/jasongrimes/fretboardfoundation/tree/main/bin).
